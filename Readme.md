# Liquor Locator
Liquor Locator is a website designed specifically for locating establishments which hold a liquor license. To locate such an establishment the user can, in the current prototype, enter the name of the city/town where they wish to purchase liquor. If the user wishes to restrict their search by the specific type of liquor license estalishments hold, they can select the license type from the drop down menu below the search bar.

Once a search has been entered, the list on the right hand side of the screen will be populated with any results matching the search constraints. The user can then select any of these results and a pop up window will display more information about the selected establishment.
